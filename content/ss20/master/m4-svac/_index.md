## Description
In computer science, an estimation of hundreds of thousands to millions of scientific publications are published every year. Even though the content of the publications is usually placed behind a payment barrier, some metadata are freely accessible, such as title, abstract, keywords of the publication, name of the conference, or names and universities of the authors. A well-known publication series for computer science is the ["Lecture Notes in Computer Science"](https://link.springer.com/bookseries/558) by Springer-Verlag. Since 1973, more than twelve thousand books have been published in this series with a total of several hundred thousand individual publications. The aim of the project was to visualize and analyze the metadata of these publications.

For this purpose, the data first had to be extracted using web scraping and prepared for further processing using a range of different methods. This involved the use of *Natural Language Processing*. Data from over XX publications, XX universities, XX authors and XX keywords had to be normalized and cleaned. The main difficulties were to find duplicates within the inconsistent spellings and partially missing information of identical data sets. In the end, various analyses could be done on the basis of these revised data and the findings could be visualized.

Topics that were analyzed include:

* Relationships between universities and authors
* Relationships between keywords
* Development of keyword popularity
* ...
