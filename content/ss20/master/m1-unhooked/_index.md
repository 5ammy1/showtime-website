## Beschreibung

Why do mobile applications make you cost us so much time? Why do we spend every free minute on our smartphone? How do we find this applicatios so tempting that every time the smartphone flashes, we pick it up and leave everything else behind and then when we look at the smartphone we forget everything around us.

Why can applications and social media applicastions do something that can cast a spell on us?

We wanted to develop a mobile web e-learning application that addresses exactly these points and explains these mechanisims. “unhooked” was born.
