## Beschreibung
### Product Vision
We want to create a virtual reality game by exploring and experimenting with technology. Our game will present a playful experience in an environment with climbing and hunting features. Our ambitious mission is to make people experience the possibilities of virtual reality.

### The Hunters Paths
We called our game "The Hunters Path" because the protagonist should be a hunter. In the first level you get introduced in the first mechanic, which is climbing. After you passed this test the second mechaning "hunting". You can decide if you hunt with sword or like more immersive with bow and arrow. In the end there will we a fight against a strong animal which should be hunted down.
