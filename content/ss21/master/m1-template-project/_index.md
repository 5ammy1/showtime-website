{{<section title="The Team">}}
- **Communication is key.** Everyone was working towards the same goal and we all agreed on the importance of communication in that process.
- Everyone of us found something that they were passionate about, which made our development process both **fun and motivating.**
- Henry, Jonathan and Anton were at first responsible for the backend while Kieu, Kenneth and Niklas were implementing the text recognition and UI but we switched around later on.
