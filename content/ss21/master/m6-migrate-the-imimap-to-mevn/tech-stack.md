{{<section title="Tech Stack">}}
MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js und Node.js) as the tech stack was decided upon before the project started. The study program is increasingly using more modern JavaScript-based Frameworks and the IMI-Map was supposed to become more easily integratable into other courses and student projects. Here are the components of MEVN:

**MongoDB**
* a document based database

**Express.js**
* a JavaScript-Webframework

**Vue.js**
* a JavaScript-Framework for frontend development

**Node.js**
* a JavaScript-Runtime

* Issues for keeping track of tasks
* Version control

**Miro**
* Documentation of Decisions
* Visualisation of Processes and Ideas
