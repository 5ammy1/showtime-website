With this version of the IMI-Map we have acheived a significant improvement over the previous version. But we sincerely hope the long tradition of student projects and thesis will continue and further generations of IMIs will continue maintaining and improving the IMI-Map.

And we already have a few ideas:

{{<section title="Future Ideas">}}
**Review Processes**

The idea for a possibility of reviewing internships in the IMI-Map has been around since before our project. It has come up during our project as well before it became clear that it would fall outsinde of the scope of this project.

Students could be asked to review their internships according to a few different categories. Other students that are looking for internships using the IMI-Map could then get more information about the placement and the expreience and make a more informed decision.

**PDF Parsing**

Because the IMI-Map can now handle all of the required PDF-documents, these documents could be parsed for information. For example:
* Once the contract is uploaded it could be parsed for information so the student does not have to enter place of work, working hours and salary themselfes.
* Once the student uploaded the grade transscript there could be an automatic check to see wether the student has completed all the required courses or not so the internship officer does not have to check this manually.

**LSF Connection**

The Student could grant the IMI-Map access to their grade transscript via LSF directly. This would eliminate the need for the student to download their grade transscript from LSF and then upload it again into the IMI-Map.


**Login via SAML**

The Login could be changed to use SAML instead of LDAP so the Users of the IMI-Map don't have to give teir HTW-Password to the IMI-Map but can sign on via the HTW sign on service.
